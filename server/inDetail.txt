make a new route named as exccessiveCheck and do all this check and make a new route exccessiveReport and give me the report When building a website security scanner, you can incorporate various security checks to assess potential vulnerabilities. These checks can include basic security headers, SSL certificates, and more advanced analysis, such as vulnerability scanning or even identifying outdated software.

Here are several types of security checks that you can incorporate into your scan, along with third-party packages or modules that can help:

1. SSL/TLS Certificate Checks
Ensure the site uses HTTPS and has a valid SSL certificate.

What to check:
HTTPS presence.
SSL certificate validity (is it expired or self-signed?).
Strength of SSL protocols and ciphers.
Packages:
ssl-checker
node-ssl-checker
js
Copy code
const sslChecker = require('ssl-checker');

sslChecker('example.com').then(result => {
    console.log(result);
    // Check if SSL is valid, the expiry date, and supported protocols
});
2. Security Headers Check
Scan for critical HTTP security headers that help mitigate attacks like XSS, clickjacking, and MIME-type sniffing.

What to check:

X-Content-Type-Options
X-Frame-Options
Content-Security-Policy
Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
Referrer-Policy
Permissions-Policy
Packages:

helmet-csp
http-security-headers-check
js
Copy code
const helmetCsp = require('helmet-csp');

// Example to check Content-Security-Policy headers (you can adjust based on what's being returned)
app.use(helmetCsp({
    directives: {
        defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
        styleSrc: ["'self'", 'https:'],
        scriptSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
        objectSrc: ["'none'"],
        upgradeInsecureRequests: [],
    }
}));
3. Vulnerability Scanning
Check if the website is vulnerable to well-known vulnerabilities (SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting, etc.).

What to check:
SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF vulnerabilities.
Open ports.
CMS-related vulnerabilities (e.g., outdated WordPress plugins).
Packages:
node-wpscan (for WordPress)
retire (find known vulnerable libraries)
bash
Copy code
npm install -g retire
retire --outputformat json --outputpath ./vulnerabilityReport.json
You can integrate OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) or Nikto into your backend for more advanced scanning. These tools perform automated vulnerability scans.
4. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Check
Detect whether the site is susceptible to XSS attacks (via JavaScript injection).

What to check:

Reflective or stored XSS vulnerabilities.
Any scripts that are not properly sanitized.
Packages:

xss-filters
js
Copy code
const xssFilters = require('xss-filters');

const safeOutput = xssFilters.inHTMLData('<script>alert("test")</script>');
console.log(safeOutput); // Ensures the script is sanitized properly
5. Content Security Policy (CSP) Check
Ensure that the site has a robust Content Security Policy to prevent code injection and data theft.

What to check:

Does the site implement a CSP header?
Are third-party resources limited and properly defined?
Packages:

csp-evaluator
js
Copy code
const evaluator = require('csp-evaluator');
const policies = 'Content-Security-Policy: default-src https:;';
const result = evaluator.evaluate(policies);
console.log(result);
6. Open Ports Scanning
Identify open ports that might expose services (such as FTP, SSH, or database servers) to attacks.

What to check:
Scan for open ports that shouldn't be exposed publicly (e.g., database ports).
Packages:
portscanner
js
Copy code
const portscanner = require('portscanner');

// Check if a common dangerous port is open
portscanner.checkPortStatus(21, 'example.com', function(error, status) {
    console.log(status); // Status is 'open' or 'closed'
});
7. Outdated Software/Dependencies Check
Check for outdated libraries, CMS software (like WordPress or Joomla), or packages that might contain known vulnerabilities.

What to check:
WordPress or other CMS versions.
Check if JavaScript libraries (jQuery, etc.) are outdated.
Packages:
retire.js (for JavaScript libraries)
snyk (checks for vulnerable dependencies in Node.js)
bash
Copy code
npm install -g retire
retire --outputformat json --outputpath ./outdated-libraries.json
8. SQL Injection Check
Detect potential vulnerabilities for SQL injection by testing whether user inputs are properly sanitized.

What to check:
Test for SQL Injection vulnerabilities in form submissions and URL parameters.
Packages:
Use tools like sqlmap to test SQL injection manually or integrate its results into your system.
For basic form scanning, you can simulate SQL injection by sending typical payloads like ' OR 1=1 --.
9. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection Check
Ensure that the website has proper CSRF tokens to protect users from malicious form submissions.

What to check:
Verify if the site is using CSRF tokens in forms or state-changing requests (POST/PUT/DELETE).
Packages:
csurf
js
Copy code
const csrf = require('csurf');
const csrfProtection = csrf({ cookie: true });

app.use(csrfProtection);
10. External Link Security (HTTP Strict Transport Security)
Check if the website enforces HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) and disallows loading insecure resources.

What to check:
Strict-Transport-Security header.
Packages:
hsts
js
Copy code
const hsts = require('hsts');

// Example: Set HSTS headers
app.use(hsts({
  maxAge: 31536000, // 1 year
  includeSubDomains: true, // Also cover subdomains
  preload: true
}));
11. Rate Limiting & DDoS Protection
Check if the website has rate limiting in place to prevent denial-of-service attacks.

What to check:
Check if requests are throttled after a certain number.
Packages:
express-rate-limit
js
Copy code
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');

// Example: Set basic rate limiting
const limiter = rateLimit({
    windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
    max: 100 // limit each IP to 100 requests per window
});

app.use(limiter);
12. Cookie Security Check
Ensure that cookies are secure and HTTP-only.

What to check:
Are cookies marked as Secure and HttpOnly?
Packages:
Can manually check by looking at the Set-Cookie header in responses.
Use helmet to ensure proper security headers are applied.
js
Copy code
const helmet = require('helmet');

app.use(helmet({
  hsts: {
    maxAge: 31536000, // 1 year
    includeSubDomains: true,
    preload: true
  }
}));
13. DNS Security
Check DNS settings to ensure the website has DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) and proper SPF/DKIM for email security.

What to check:

DNSSEC (ensures integrity of DNS records).
SPF/DKIM (ensures email legitimacy).
Packages:

dns (for DNS lookups).
Conclusion
Incorporating security headers, SSL checks, vulnerability scans, and more advanced checks like open port scanning can significantly improve the thoroughness of your website security scanner. Many of these checks can be handled with packages or integrated tools like OWASP ZAP for automated security assessments.

Let me know if you'd like a deeper implementation of any specific module!


To improve the accuracy of your scan logic so that it returns both good and bad results depending on the website, you need to:

Enhance the simulation logic by identifying and checking specific performance and security metrics of the website.
Incorporate third-party libraries (for more realistic checks) that can assess the URL's security headers, performance metrics, and even fetch some real data from the URL.
Use a combination of static checks (e.g., scanning for HTTPS, security headers) and dynamic checks (e.g., performance metrics like load time).
Approach to Improve the Scan Logic:
Check for HTTPS
If a website doesnâ€™t use HTTPS, it's flagged as insecure.
Check for Performance Issues
Use the axios library to fetch the website and check the size of assets (JavaScript, CSS, images).
Measure response time (e.g., Time to First Byte, overall load time).
Check Security Headers
Check for the presence of important security headers like X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, Strict-Transport-Security, etc.
Simulate Load Time Issues
Use the actual response time of the request to flag slow websites.
